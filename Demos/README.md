# Microsoft Graph: Building Microsoft Graph Applications - 200 Level

This folder contains demos for the Building Microsoft Graph Applications module.

## Demos

- [Console application](./01-console-application)
- [JavaScript application](./02-angular-connect-rest)
- [Azure Function](./03-dotnet-daemon)
- [Xamarin mobile app](./04-xamarin-application)

## Running demonstrations

Each demonstration is included as source code for convenience. However, several of the projects rely on other source code repositories. It is recommended that you obtain the original source and configure the projects according to the instructions in those repositories.

Each project has been updated to leverage configuration files when possible instead of editing source code files.
